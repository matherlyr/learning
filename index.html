Learning!!

Learning can occur in many different ways. I've always heard that there are three types of learners. There's the auditory <br>
who learns best when listening to class material. Then, some people are visual learners that need to either see a picture or <br>
need read something to best understand content. And finally, tactile learners use physical objects and actions to learn most<br>
efficiently. Derek Muller and Carol Dweck, however, are education experts and they have some pretty good insight on how learning<br>
actually works.
<br>
<br>
Carol Dweck show us in her video that there are two different educational mindsets: fixed and growth. She says a child with a<br>
fixed mindset thinks that intelligence is something that you are gifted with, so you are either intelligent or not intelligent.<br>
Whereas with the growth mindset kids, they believe every one is different and that everyone can learn if they are willing to <br>
put in the effort. Dweck, then, presents research showing that children with a growth mindset end up earning better grades in<br>
classes. Another research she showed was one where they tried to teach the growth mindset. The conclusion of the study said that<br>
by learning about the growth mindset and other study skills, a percentage of the people in the study actually develped a growth<br>
mindset. Also, she show pictures of the brain activity of people with both mindsets when faced with a challenging task. The brain<br>
with the fixed mindset was all green because once the person realized they were being challenged, they gave up on the task. <br>
In contrast, the growth mindset brain was almost entirely red because the person was recognizing the problems that were in front<br>
of them and tried to fix them.
<br>
<br>
In addition, Dreck Muller tells us that in order for people to learn, he asks people common misconceptions and takes their incorrect<br>
answers as an opportunity to teach about the misconception. Although some people give some funny answers to his questions, he really<br>
doesn't want to make them look stupid. He wants them to learn from their mistakes and fix the common misconceptions.
<br>
<br>
Both of these concepts of learning conclude that learning is an important aspect of life and that there are many ways to do it.<br>
Both of them share the fact that successful learning is done when you work towards understanding. For example, many people do not<br>
know that a tree is mosty made from carbon dioxide. You work, however, to make people understand that and people of growth mindsets<br>
understand that it takes work to gain understanding. This applies to no matter what kind of learner you are!

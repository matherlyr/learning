Learning can occur in many different ways. I've always heard that there are three types of learners. There's the auditory <br>
who learns best when listening to class material. Then, some people are visual learners that need to either see a picture or <br>
need read something to best understand content. And finally, tactile learners use physical objects and actions to learn most<br>
efficiently. Derek Muller and Carol Dweck, however, are education experts and they have some pretty good insight on how learning<br>
actually works.

Carol Dweck show us in her video that there are two different educational mindsets: fixed and growth.
